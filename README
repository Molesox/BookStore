Welcome to the bookstore project that we created for the Operating Systems course at UniFR.

The general structure we chose tries to reflect the real world pretty closely :
There is a class for John, the librarian, another for the customer(s), and a main file to run the program.
Outside of those main files, there are utilities that help represent the books, the shelves and the library itself, as
well as another to contain the semaphore structure.

In our case, the library is a vector of shelves. Each shelf (representing a genre) is a hashmap (unordered_map).
This structure helps to keep book searches and changes fast and relatively efficient, which is not really necessary,
but is always a good thing to have. It also helps to keep code changes simple and clean.

An important choice we made after designing the backbone for the project is to automatically read in a huge amount
of books at startup from a database found online. There are, at the time of writing, 16559 books in this database.
